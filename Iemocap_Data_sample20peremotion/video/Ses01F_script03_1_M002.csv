47,"In this video frame, a woman is seated against a plain, light-colored wall. She has dark hair pulled back into a ponytail. She is wearing a dark short-sleeved jacket over a red top, with wristbands, and is seated in a relaxed posture. Her hands are clasped together in her lap, with her body turned slightly to one side, suggesting attentiveness or engagement. Her facial expression appears neutral but attentive, possibly indicating she is either listening or speaking in a calm manner. There are no other people in the frame, and the setting seems minimalistic, focusing the attention on her."
