The individual is wearing a plain short-sleeved shirt, and is positioned slightly hunched forward with arms resting on what might be a table or flat surface. The hands are clasped together, exhibiting a relaxed posture. The person has medium-length hair, and the expression on their face appears neutral, with eyes looking downward, suggesting a contemplative or introspective mood.
