65,"In the video frame, a person is seated on a chair, slightly leaning back in a relaxed posture. He is wearing a light-colored, short-sleeved shirt. His hands rest comfortably on his lap, and his elbows are bent at his sides. There's a faint, friendly smile on his face, suggesting a calm or content emotional state. The background is a plain, neutral-colored wall, and the lighting appears to be soft, casting a gentle glow in the room. A cable is visible hanging from the upper right corner, but it does not seem to engage the person's attention. Overall, the scene conveys a sense of ease and casual observation."
