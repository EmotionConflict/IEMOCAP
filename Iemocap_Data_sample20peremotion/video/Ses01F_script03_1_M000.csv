28,"In the video frame, a woman is seated on a chair against a plain background with no distinct features, suggesting a studio or controlled environment. She appears relaxed, with her body turned slightly to the side. Her arms rest comfortably in her lap, hands loosely clasped. The woman wears a short-sleeved, dark-colored shirt over a red top. Her dark hair is pulled back. Her expression seems calm and neutral, with a slight upward curl at the edges of her mouth, possibly hinting at a subtle interest or mild amusement. A cable runs vertically along the wall at the right edge of the frame, but there are no additional details to indicate its purpose. The setting appears simple and uncluttered."
