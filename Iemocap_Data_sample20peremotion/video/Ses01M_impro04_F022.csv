75,"In the video frame, a person is seated in a simple chair positioned against a plain, light-colored wall. They are wearing a short-sleeved, snug-fitting shirt in a muted tone. Their posture is relaxed, with arms resting on the armrests of the chair. The person's facial expression appears neutral and composed, with eyes gazing slightly upward as if focused on something in the middle distance. A soft, even lighting bathes the scene, creating subtle shadows and highlighting the contours of the personâ€™s face and clothing. The surrounding space is minimalist, enhancing the focus on the individual seated in the center. A cable can be seen trailing down from the upper right corner, extending down the wall, which adds a hint of technical ambiance to the setting."
