32,"The setting is a plain room with neutral-colored walls and minimal adornment. A woman sits relaxed in a chair positioned slightly to the right within the frame. She wears a casual dark vest over a red shirt, paired with shorts. Her body language is open; one arm rests on the chair's armrest while the other lies on her lap. She has a gentle, relaxed smile on her face, and her eyes are directed forward, suggesting engagement or attentiveness. Her expression conveys a sense of ease. There is a cable that appears to be hanging vertically along the right edge of the frame, adding a slight contrast to the otherwise simple background."
