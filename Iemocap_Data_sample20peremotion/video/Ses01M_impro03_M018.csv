25,"In the video frame, a young man is seated on a dark-colored chair against a plain, light-colored wall. He is leaning slightly forward, resting his forearms on his thighs, which creates a relaxed posture. His facial expression is a subtle smile, which conveys a sense of ease or amusement. His eyes are focused on something in front of him, suggesting he is engaged with the scene or person in that direction.

He is wearing a light-colored, short-sleeved T-shirt, and has a jacket draped over the back of the chair. His hair is somewhat long and falls naturally around his ears. The setting appears minimalistic, with no distinct objects other than a wire trailing from the ceiling, hinting at a technological environment. The manâ€™s body language, combined with his slight smile, suggests he is comfortable and perhaps anticipating something."
