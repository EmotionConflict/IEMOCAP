32,"In this video frame, a person is seated on a chair against a plain background. The individual is wearing a short-sleeved gray t-shirt and appears relaxed. Their arms rest calmly on their lap, hands loosely clasped together. The person's facial expression is neutral, with a slight lift at the mouth's corners, maybe suggesting a subtle smile or contemplation. Their posture is upright yet easy, leaning slightly back in the chair. There's a wire visible in the upper right of the frame that seems to hang down but does not interact with the person. The setting is minimalistic, with no additional objects or decorations, focusing the viewer's attention on the individual's presence and demeanor."
