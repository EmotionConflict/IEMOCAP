144,"A person is seated in a plain room with bare walls and a simple, uncluttered background, perhaps a lab or studio. They're sitting on a cushioned black chair or stool, wearing a close-fitting gray T-shirt. Their arms are resting casually on their lap. The individual's expression appears to show a moment of contemplation or concentration, with lips slightly pursed. The lighting casts soft shadows, suggesting an artificial source from above or to the side. The atmosphere is quiet and focused, with no visible distractions around. A single cable descends from above, adding a slight technical element to the setting."
