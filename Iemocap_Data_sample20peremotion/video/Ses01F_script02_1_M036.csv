28,"In the frame, a woman is seated against a neutral-colored wall. Her posture is relaxed, with her head tilted slightly to one side. She wears a dark short-sleeved outer garment over a reddish top. Her hands rest gently on her lap, fingers loosely interlaced. Her facial expression appears calm, and perhaps introspective, as her gaze is directed downward toward her hands. Her hair is pulled back neatly, and there is a sense of stillness in her demeanor, suggesting she might be listening or contemplating something. The setting is minimal, focusing attention on her and her composed body language."
