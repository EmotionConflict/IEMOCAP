90,"In the video frame, a woman is seated against a plain, light-colored background, positioned slightly angled to the side with her head slightly tilted. Her hair is pulled back casually, and she is wearing a red top beneath a dark, open shirt. Her expression suggests she might be lost in thought or mildly engaged in observation, as her eyes are directed slightly to one side, and her lips are pressed together in a neutral to slightly pensive line. Her posture is relaxed; both arms rest comfortably along her lap, with her hands interlinked, conveying a sense of ease or contemplation. The setting is minimalistic, with attention focused entirely on her expression and posture, accentuated by soft lighting."
