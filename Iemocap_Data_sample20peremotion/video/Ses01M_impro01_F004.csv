90,"In this scene, a man is seated on a chair facing slightly to the left of the frame. He is wearing a plain, fitted t-shirt that outlines his relaxed posture. His arms are lightly resting on his knees, suggesting a casual and at-ease demeanor. His expression appears contemplative, with a slight tilt of his head as he gazes downward. The environment around him is minimal, with a smooth, neutral-colored wall as the backdrop. The lighting is soft, casting gentle shadows that add a sense of depth to his facial features. The overall mood is calm, with no visible tension in his body language."
