36,"In this scene, a woman is seated comfortably in a chair positioned against a plain, light-colored wall, suggesting a simple setting, possibly a studio or a lab. She has dark hair tied back in a ponytail, keeping her hair neatly away from her face. She wears a short-sleeved, dark top over a darker shirt, creating a layered look. Her focus is directed slightly to the side, as if looking at someone or something outside the frame. Her expression is neutral to slightly attentive, her lips gently closed.

Her posture is relaxed, with her hands resting lightly in her lap, fingers gently intertwined. Her sleeves are rolled up slightly, a gesture that might suggest she is in a casual or comfortable environment. The lighting in the room is even, emphasizing no particular emotions through shadow or highlight, which contributes to a calm and controlled atmosphere. The setting seems quiet and focused, with her demeanor indicating that she is possibly listening or waiting for something to happen."
