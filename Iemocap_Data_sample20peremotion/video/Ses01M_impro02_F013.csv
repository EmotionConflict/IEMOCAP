70,"In the video frame, a person is seated against a simple, light-colored backdrop. They are wearing a plain short-sleeved shirt. Their posture is relaxed, leaning slightly forward as they rest their elbows on their knees, hands loosely clasped together. Their gaze is directed slightly upwards and to the side, suggesting they might be listening or pondering something. The person's hair is slightly tousled, and their facial expression is neutral, with a hint of contemplation. The setting appears minimalistic, focusing attention primarily on the individual. The lighting is soft, casting gentle shadows without creating harsh contrasts."
