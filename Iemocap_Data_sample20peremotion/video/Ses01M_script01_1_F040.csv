129,"In the video frame, a man is seated in a simple, unfurnished room. He is wearing a plain, short-sleeved gray t-shirt, and sits in a slightly reclined posture on a black chair. His arms are relaxed, resting on his lap, and his hands are loosely clasped together. His facial expression is calm, with eyes gently closed as if in a moment of rest or contemplation.

The lighting in the room is soft, casting an even glow over the man's face and clothing, which suggests a serene or neutral mood. The walls are a plain, light color, contributing to the simplicity and minimalism of the setting. A thin cord or wire is visible along the wall, adding just a slight element of the everyday to the scene. There are no other discernible objects or people present, emphasizing the solitary focus on the seated individual."
